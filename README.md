# step1:S3 Bucket Creation
Navigate to the S3 service in the AWS console and create a new S3 bucket

Give it a unique name, and then leave all the defaults as in. Make sure to select the region that you intend to run this whole lab in. This bucket is where we will upload our code later.

# step2:IAM EC2 Instance Role Creation
Navigate to the IAM dashboard in the AWS console and create an EC2 role.

Select EC2 as the trusted entity.
